## Who am I?

I'm Takuya TAKAHASHI working in Japan as a Software and Site Reliability Enginner.

My base is cloud infrastructure such as server virtualization on kvm, qemu, and cloud networkng.

I've worked at Yahoo! JAPAN for 2 years as Cloud Infrastructure Enginner.
I was developped OpenStack Neutron (Networking component) plugin here.

I'm interested in DevOps and container orcastration. For example, Kubernetes, Docker, gVisor, and so on.

I want to work as a DevOps Enginner. And I'm sure I'm good at developing DevOps workflow and pipeline because I'm working as a Backend Enginner using Ruby on Rails.

So, I can concern about both of application and infrastructure enginner.

My achievement was published in Google Cloud Next Japan at 2018.
